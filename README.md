The basics folder consists of setup instructions and programs to check the OpenAI credentials and making simple API calls.

The other folders are code from deeplearning.ai that has been updated to work with OpenAI version 1.57. The code examples are run outside the jupyter notebook.

## Completion

The completion.py makes a direct API call to OpenAI. It shows how to view the structure of the returned response. This is useful when you want to navigate the response object and extract the answer.
