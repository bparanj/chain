**Task Breakdown Structure (High-Level, Technology-Agnostic)**

1. **Identify Content Source**  
   - Determine the website to analyze.  
   - Locate or generate a list of pages or content paths (e.g., from a sitemap).

2. **Set Up Environment**  
   - Prepare a workspace or environment where data can be collected and processed.  
   - Ensure credentials or keys for any necessary external services are available.

3. **Acquire Website Content**  
   - Retrieve text from each identified page.  
   - Extract, clean, and structure the textual data for further processing.

4. **Transform and Store Content**  
   - Convert the text into a format suitable for semantic search (e.g., embeddings or another vector representation).  
   - Store these transformed representations in a searchable data structure or system.

5. **Implement Retrieval Mechanism**  
   - Create a method to query stored content based on similarity or relevance.  
   - Ensure the mechanism can quickly return the most pertinent sections of content for any given query.

6. **Integrate Question-Answering Logic**  
   - Use a language-based reasoning component to understand user questions.  
   - Combine retrieved content with language understanding to generate coherent answers.

7. **User Interaction Interface**  
   - Provide a means for users to input questions and receive answers.  
   - This could be a command-line interface, API endpoint, or another form of interaction.

8. **Testing and Refinement**  
   - Test the system with a range of questions.  
   - Assess answer quality and relevance.  
   - Refine data processing, retrieval methods, or answering logic as needed.

9. **Deployment and Sharing**  
   - Host the application in a stable, accessible environment.  
   - Provide a public link or interface for end-users to access the Q&A functionality.

10. **Optional Front-End Integration**  
    - Develop a simple, user-friendly graphical interface if desired.  
    - Make the final solution easy to navigate and interact with for non-technical users.
