pyenv: pip: command not found

The `pip' command exists in these Python versions:
  3.10.16

Note: See 'pyenv help global' for tips on allowing both
      python2 and python3 to be found.

This error occurs when pip isn't available in your current Python environment. Since pyenv shows that pip exists in Python 3.10.16, here are a few steps to resolve this:

1. Either set Python 3.10.16 as your global Python version:
```bash
pyenv global 3.10.16
```

2. Or activate Python 3.10.16 for your current shell session:
```bash
pyenv shell 3.10.16
```

After doing either of these, pip should be available. You can verify by running:
```bash
pip --version
```

If you still have issues, you might need to rehash pyenv to update its shims:
```bash
pyenv rehash
```
